To install on lighthouse, scp and ssh into box and use command:
  sudo ./install
Wait for librarian to restart and the plugin should be ready for use.

To install on pi, scp and ssh into the pi and use command:
  sudo ./install.pi
Wait for librarian to restart and the plugin should be ready for use.

There is a weird bug that when the ssid is set to a new ssid, the current window redirects to a blank success page (intention of page) and a new browser is opened for librarian. Perhaps the behavior on startup could be altered with the addition of an "SSID changed" token, or something.

Please note that you must connect to the new SSID when the connection has been lost.
